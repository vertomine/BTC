            <p class="intro-title">Profit Logic:</p>
            <p>
                This strategy is to open both long and short positions, calculate the full position operation 
                by splitting the positions, and the profit direction has a reverse floating loss. There will 
                be large fluctuations at the beginning. When the positions are slowly replenished and the 
                average price is pulled very close, there will be positive profits at this time. Then, the 
                set global stop profit parameters will trigger all positions to close and open new positions. 
                The profit will be automatically transferred to the spot and separated from the principal by 
                default, and then continue to open positions at the latest price to prevent the long and short 
                span from being particularly large and resulting in no profit for many days or even increasing 
                floating losses.
